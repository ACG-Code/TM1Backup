# TM1 Backup Service

A robust, automated backup utility for IBM Planning Analytics (TM1) databases. This tool provides reliable, compressed backups with intelligent retention management and log cleanup capabilities.

## Overview

TM1 Backup Service is a command-line utility designed to automate the backup process for TM1 databases. It uses 7-Zip compression to create efficient backup archives, manages backup retention automatically, and can clean up old TM1 log files to keep your environment tidy.

## Features

- **Automated Database Backup**: Creates compressed backups of TM1 database directories
- **Flexible Compression**: Supports both 7z (default) and ZIP formats
- **Feeder File Control**: Option to include or exclude feeder files from backups
- **Intelligent Retention**: Automatically manages backup files, keeping only the most recent N backups
- **Log File Cleanup**: Removes old TM1 log files based on configurable retention period
- **Timestamped Archives**: Each backup includes a timestamp for easy identification
- **Multi-threaded Compression**: Utilizes multi-threading for faster backup operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging with automatic rotation (7-day retention)
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows (with bundled 7-Zip executable)

## Requirements

### For Running from Source
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `docopt` - Command-line argument parsing

### For Compiled Executable
- No Python installation required
- 7-Zip executable (7z.exe) must be in the same directory or in the `files` subdirectory

### System Requirements
- Windows operating system
- Sufficient disk space for backup files
- Read access to TM1 database directory
- Write access to backup destination directory

## Installation

### Option 1: Use Pre-compiled Executable (Recommended)
1. Download the latest release from the repository
2. Extract to your desired location
3. Ensure `7z.exe` is in the same directory or in a `files` subdirectory
4. Run from command line or Task Scheduler

### Option 2: Run from Source
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install docopt
   ```
3. Download 7-Zip and place `7z.exe` in a `files` subdirectory
4. Run using Python:
   ```bash
   python app.py <arguments>
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
tm1backup <servername> <source> <destination> <logdir> [options]
```

### Positional Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<servername>` | TM1 instance name (used in backup filename) |
| `<source>` | Full path to TM1 database directory |
| `<destination>` | Directory where backup files will be stored |
| `<logdir>` | Full path to TM1 log directory |

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-f` | Include feeder files in backup | Excluded |
| `-k <kn>` | Keep most recent `kn` backup files | 1 |
| `-l <ln>` | Keep `ln` days of TM1 log files | -1 (disabled) |
| `-z` | Use ZIP format instead of 7z | 7z format |
| `-h` | Show help screen | - |
| `--version` | Show version information | - |

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Backup
Create a backup with default settings (keeps 1 backup, excludes feeders, uses 7z format):

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData"
```

### Example 2: Keep Multiple Backups
Keep the 5 most recent backup files:

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -k 5
```

### Example 3: Include Feeder Files
Create backup including feeder files:

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -f
```

### Example 4: Clean Old Logs
Keep 7 days of TM1 log files, removing older ones:

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -l 7
```

### Example 5: Use ZIP Format
Create backup in ZIP format instead of 7z:

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -z
```

### Example 6: Complete Configuration
Keep 3 backups, include feeders, clean 14 days of logs:

```bash
tm1backup SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -f -k 3 -l 14
```

## Backup File Naming

Backup files are automatically named using the following pattern:

```
<servername>_Backup_<timestamp>.<format>
```

Example:
```
SData_Backup_20250123143052.7z
```

Where the timestamp format is: `YYYYMMDDHHmmSS`

## Scheduling Automated Backups

### Using Windows Task Scheduler

1. **Open Task Scheduler**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter

2. **Create a New Task**
   - Click "Create Task" (not "Create Basic Task")
   - Give it a name like "TM1 Daily Backup - SData"

3. **Configure General Tab**
   - Select "Run whether user is logged on or not"
   - Check "Run with highest privileges"

4. **Configure Triggers Tab**
   - Click "New"
   - Set schedule (e.g., Daily at 2:00 AM)
   - Ensure it's enabled

5. **Configure Actions Tab**
   - Click "New"
   - Action: "Start a program"
   - Program/script: Full path to `tm1backup.exe`
   - Add arguments: Your backup command arguments
   - Example arguments:
     ```
     SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -k 7 -l 14
     ```

6. **Configure Conditions Tab**
   - Uncheck "Start the task only if the computer is on AC power" (for laptops)

7. **Save the Task**
   - Enter credentials when prompted

### Example Batch File

You can also create a batch file for easier scheduling:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "C:\Path\To\TM1Backup"
tm1backup.exe SData "C:\TM1Data\SData" "D:\Backups\TM1" "C:\TM1Data\SData" -k 7 -l 14
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Backup failed! >> backup_errors.log
    exit /b 1
)
echo Backup completed successfully
exit /b 0
```

## Logging

The application maintains a log file (`TM1Backup.log`) in the same directory as the executable. The log includes:

- Backup operation start and completion times
- Configuration details for each backup
- File sizes of created backups
- Retention cleanup activities
- Any errors or warnings encountered

Logs are automatically rotated daily with 7 days of retention.

## Log File Cleanup

When the `-l` option is used with a value greater than 0, the tool will clean up old TM1 log files:

**Files cleaned:**
- `TM1ProcessError*.*` - All TM1 process error logs
- `TM1S??????????????.*` - TM1 server logs (14-digit timestamp pattern)

**Retention logic:**
- Files older than the specified number of days are removed
- More recent files are preserved
- Cleanup is performed after each successful backup

## Troubleshooting

### "Source path does not exist"
- Verify the TM1 database path is correct
- Ensure you have read permissions to the directory
- Check for typos in the path

### "7-Zip executable not found"
- Ensure `7z.exe` is in the same directory as the executable
- Or place it in a `files` subdirectory
- Verify the file name is exactly `7z.exe`

### "Destination path does not exist"
- Create the backup destination directory before running
- Verify you have write permissions to the directory

### Backup files not being cleaned up
- Verify the `-k` option is set with a value greater than 0
- Check that backup files follow the naming pattern `<servername>_Backup_*.<format>`
- Ensure the destination directory is writable

### Slow backup performance
- Consider using 7z format (default) instead of ZIP for better compression
- Check available disk space
- Verify no other processes are heavily accessing the source directory

## Best Practices

1. **Test your backup command manually** before scheduling it
2. **Monitor the log file** regularly for errors
3. **Verify backup files** can be extracted successfully
4. **Keep multiple backup copies** using the `-k` option (recommend 7-14 days)
5. **Store backups on a different drive** than the TM1 database for disaster recovery
6. **Schedule backups during low-usage periods** to minimize performance impact
7. **Test your restore procedure** periodically
8. **Clean up old logs** regularly using the `-l` option to save disk space

## File Size Considerations

### 7z Format (Default)
- **Pros**: Better compression ratio, smaller backup files
- **Cons**: Slightly longer compression time
- **Recommended for**: Most scenarios, especially with large databases

### ZIP Format
- **Pros**: Faster compression, universally compatible
- **Cons**: Larger backup files
- **Recommended for**: When backup time is more critical than storage space

### Feeder Files
- Including feeder files (`-f` option) can significantly increase backup size
- Only include feeders if you need to restore the exact rule compilation state
- Most restores work fine without feeder files (they will be regenerated)

## Exit Codes

The application returns the following exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Failure (check log for details) |
| 130 | User cancelled (Ctrl+C) |

These can be useful for monitoring in batch scripts or automation tools.
